Functions:

sigma(uL, lL, op, incVal); - Performs the sigma notation\n
uL = upper limit, number\n
lL = lower limit, number\n
op = operation, string: "+" for addition, "-" for subtraction, "/" for division, "*" for multiplication, "^" for squaring\n
incVal = value to increase by, number, set to string "lL" to make it increment intself each iteration. \n
